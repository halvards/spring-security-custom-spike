# spring-security-custom-spike

Spike to work out how to use a custom web service for authentication with Spring Security in a Spring Boot application.

<http://localhost:8085/app/hello.json> is a protected resource. Any User ID is acceptable, Family Name must be "bloggs" (case insensitive).
 
Use <http://localhost:8085/app/logout> via HTTP GET to log out.
